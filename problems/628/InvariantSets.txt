PROBLEM STATEMENT
Janusz is a young physicist.
Recently he has been studying a dynamic system.
There are n elements in the system.
We will label them 0 through n-1.
The set of all elements will be denoted E.

Janusz models the changes in his system using a function that operates on elements of E.
You are given this function as a vector <int> f with n elements, each between 0 and n-1, inclusive.
The vector <int> f describes Janusz's function as follows:
For each valid i, if the function is given the input i, its output will be f[i].

For Janusz, invariant subsets of E have a special significance.
A subset S of the set E is called invariant (with respect to f) if it has the following property: for any x in S, f[x] is also in S.
For example, the entire set E is invariant (for any f).
The empty set is always invariant as well.

Given is the vector <int> f.
Compute and return the number of invariant subsets of E (including E itself and the empty set).

DEFINITION
Class:InvariantSets
Method:countSets
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long countSets(vector <int> f)


NOTES
-You may assume that the return value will fit into integer type long long.


CONSTRAINTS
-f will have between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of f will be between 0 and n-1, inclusive, where n is the number of elements of f.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,0,0,0}

Returns: 5

The invariant sets are: {}, {0,1}, {0,1,2}, {0,1,3}, {0,1,2,3}.

1)
{1,2,0}

Returns: 2

There are only 2 invariants sets: {} and {0,1,2}.

2)
{0,0,1,2}

Returns: 5

The invariant sets are: {}, {0}, {0,1}, {0,1,2}, {0,1,2,3}.

3)
{0,1,2,3,4,5}

Returns: 64

Every set is invariant when f(x)=x for all x.

4)
{12, 10, 0, 4, 0, 6, 3, 8, 9, 14, 1, 5, 6, 12, 5}

Returns: 90
