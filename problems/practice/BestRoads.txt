PROBLEM STATEMENT
There are N cities numbered 0 to N-1.  The j-th character of the i-th element of roads is 'Y' if there is a bidirectional road between cities i and j, and 'N' otherwise.

The road connecting cities A and B, where A < B, has a higher priority than the road connecting cities C and D, where C < D, if either A < C or (A = C and B < D).  A set of roads is a list of one or more roads sorted from highest to lowest priority.  A set S1 has a higher priority than set S2 if road S1[i] has a higher priority than road S2[i], where i is the earliest index at which the two sets differ. A set of roads is called connected if there's a path between any pair of cities containing only the roads from this set.

Your task is to find the connected set with the highest priority containing exactly M roads.  Return a vector <int> where the i-th element is the number of roads in that set containing city i as an endpoint.  Return an empty vector <int> if there is no such set.

DEFINITION
Class:BestRoads
Method:numberOfRoads
Parameters:vector <string>, int
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> numberOfRoads(vector <string> roads, int M)


CONSTRAINTS
-roads will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-M will be between N-1 and 1,000, inclusive, where N is the number of elements in roads. 
-Each element of roads will contain exactly N characters 'Y' or 'N', where N is the number of elements in roads. 
-For each i and j roads[i][j] will be equal to roads[j][i]. 
-For each i roads[i][i] will be equal to 'N'. 


EXAMPLES

0)
{"NYYYY","YNYYY","YYNYY","YYYNY","YYYYN"}
10

Returns: {4, 4, 4, 4, 4 }

All roads should be selected.

1)
{"NYY","YNY","YYN"}
2

Returns: {2, 1, 1 }

The set must contain roads 0-1 and 0-2.

2)
{"NYNNY","YNNNY","NNNNN","NNNNY","YYNYN"}
4

Returns: { }

City 2 can not be connected to others.

3)
{"NYYNYYYN","YNNNNYYN","YNNNYNNN","NNNNNNYY","YNYNNNNN","YYNNNNYY","YYNYNYNY","NNNYNYYN"}
10

Returns: {5, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1 }

4)
{"NNYY","NNYY","YYNN","YYNN"}
5

Returns: { }

There are totally 4 roads, so we can't choose 5 of them.
