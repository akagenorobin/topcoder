PROBLEM STATEMENT

Devu likes to play with binary strings: strings in which each character is either '0' or '1'.





Devu calls a binary string beautiful if it is nonempty and no two consecutive characters in the string are equal..
The beauty level of a binary string is the number of beautiful substrings it contains.
For example, the beauty level of "0001" is 5.
This string contains four beautiful substrings of length 1 and one beautiful substring of length 2.





You are given ints n and cnt.
Return the number of binary strings of length n with beauty level equal to cnt.


DEFINITION
Class:DevuAndBeautifulSubstrings
Method:countBeautifulSubstrings
Parameters:int, int
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long countBeautifulSubstrings(int n, int cnt)


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.  
-cnt will be between 0 and n * (n + 1) / 2, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
2
2

Returns: 2

There are four binary strings of length 2: "00", "01", "10", and "11".
Their beauty levels are 2, 3, 3, and 2, respectively.
Hence, there are two binary strings of length 2 with beauty level 2.

1)
2
1

Returns: 0

There is no binary string of length 2 with beauty level 1.

2)
3
4

Returns: 4



3)
15
35

Returns: 642



4)
40
820

Returns: 2
